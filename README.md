Hi guys, 

My project is all about creativity. I have made the website RAW BANANAS. just like imdb. Below is the detail of my project.
About the Project :- 
  
  1.  This project is a clone of IMDB website made with the help of OMDB API.

  2.  You can search any movie and get details of the movie.

  3.  You can create your customized favourite movies list.

  4.  The most important thing about this project is it makes use of local storage of your browser that means if you accidentally close the tab  or  entire window, the list you created is not gone. When you revisit the page you find it same as you left. 

  5. The movie in the list is deleted only when you personally delete it from the list.

  6. It consist the function previous search that shows what did have search recently.
